How did the proposal take place?

Unknown speaker 01:10 
Well, we were together, we were together five years. We literally have never had an argument or forget about the word fight. We never even had an argument. We just are very compatible. We get along and I just said, you know what, it's time. And it wasn't a big deal. It was almost like it was obvious.

Unknown speaker 01:36 
And Melania by the way is on the latest cover of the cover of Weddings from InStyle magazine.

Unknown speaker 01:50 
Did you want that elaborate wedding?

Unknown speaker 01:53 
Yes, when I start to planning it was a lot of fun. So I I loved it. I loved my dress. I love I had great time in Paris. I went with uh, my great friend Andre Leon Talley. He's an amazing man and we went to Paris for one week to the shows and with Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue.

Unknown speaker 02:13 
What was the wedding like?

Unknown speaker 02:15 
Fantastic. We had a great time. I couldn't I had to work.

Unknown speaker 02:21 
That's true. That's okay.

Unknown speaker 02:22 
Was great. Was really I had a great time planning it and

Unknown speaker 02:26 
Were you nervous?

Unknown speaker 02:27 
No, not at all.

Unknown speaker 02:30 
Not at all?

Unknown speaker 02:31 
Not at all. I had a great time because we were in the relationship, right?

Unknown speaker 02:35 
Never been married before and um, we were in the relationship for a long time. So I still you

Unknown speaker 02:40 
It's still that's a grand scene.

Unknown speaker 02:42 
It it is, but you know, we know what kind of relationship we have and I don't think I should be scared of anything.

Unknown speaker 02:50 
What was a honeymoon like when people have lived together for five years?

Unknown speaker 02:54 
Uh, it was good. You know, we stayed in Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. Somebody said where are you going for the honeymoon? And our attitude was why would we leave Palm Beach? We have the most beautiful, you know, they don't call it Palm Beach for no reason. We have the most beautiful palm trees, right? So why are we gonna leave our gorgeous beautiful house called Mar-a-Lago and venture out into some tropical island where things aren't clean or whatever.

Unknown speaker 03:14 
Not clean, like people shaking hands.

Unknown speaker 03:15 
Okay.

Unknown speaker 03:17 
Did you feel different when they said man and wife?

Unknown speaker 03:20 
No. I felt that it was just so natural. I didn't feel different and I wasn't very nervous and she wasn't very we just knew what we were getting into. It just was time. It was just sort of very easy.

Unknown speaker 03:34 
Did you feel different?

Unknown speaker 03:36 
Uh, we didn't feel different at all. You know, it was really kind of you know, sometimes you say like oh, husband, wife, you know, it's like kind of joking. Uh, yeah, I use the name Trump, yes.

Unknown speaker 03:50 
Because you're proud of it?

Unknown speaker 03:51 
I'm proud of it. Yes, I am. And I married a man and you know, I'm kind of old fashion in that way that you know, you take the name ofDid your parents like him?

Unknown speaker 04:01 
Yes, they do.

Unknown speaker 04:02 
Do you want a parent? Do you want to be a mother? Yes. We want to have a family. We want to have a baby together.

Unknown speaker 04:09 
You have how many children?

Unknown speaker 04:10 
I have four.

Unknown speaker 04:11 
Four beautiful children. And they're good kids. Yeah. All really good and they're very successful. All doing well in school. They're all terrific.

Unknown speaker 04:19 
How do you feel about fatherhood again?

Unknown speaker 04:21 
I like it.

Unknown speaker 04:21 
How old are you, Don?

Unknown speaker 04:23 
Fifty eight. Young.

Unknown speaker 04:26 
It's young compared to you, right?

Unknown speaker 04:27 
Yeah, compared to me. I got a six and a five.

Unknown speaker 04:29 
My man, give me a hand here.

Unknown speaker 04:30 
Hey, I don't mind shaking. I'm telling you, there's no problem with shaking this guy's hand.

Unknown speaker 04:34 
Right.

Unknown speaker 04:35 
Just three times already. Guess I'll be I'll be washing my hands.

Unknown speaker 04:38 
Very strong.

Unknown speaker 04:39 
Do you

Unknown speaker 04:40 
Do you look forward to possibly being a father?

Unknown speaker 04:42 
Yeah, I think it's great. Look look at the way I look at it. There's nothing like a good marriage and there's nothing like having children. I have four great children.

Unknown speaker 04:50 
If you have the money, having children is great.

Unknown speaker 04:53 
Now I know Melania. I'm not gonna be doing the diapers. I'm not gonna be making the food. I may never even see the kids frankly.

Unknown speaker 04:59 
No, you won't. Okay.

Unknown speaker 05:00 
No. She will be an unbelievable mother. I'll be a good father, but I'll be you know,How do you know?Doing my deals.You know it.Oh, her? She'll be an amazing mother. There's no I have no doubt about that. She'll be an amazing mother.

Unknown speaker 05:11 
Have you been just back to Slovenia?

Unknown speaker 05:14 
Um, I've been in Slovenia two years ago.Did you go?Yes. I was there about thirteen minutes. No, it's a beautiful country. I landed, said hi mom, hi dad, bye. Boom.

Unknown speaker 05:26 
Let's show the ring.

Unknown speaker 05:27 
Can we get a close up of the ring and Donald will tell us

Unknown speaker 05:30 
as Don Rickles would say, this ring signals ships. Did you pick it? Well, I picked it and it's from Graff Jewelers. It's terrific and Oprah's jeweler.That's true. And I love Oprah. She is terrific and uh, they're just you know, it was just a nice

Unknown speaker 05:50 
Did you pick it or did you go with him?

Unknown speaker 05:52 
No, he picked it. I picked it, but she and I have very similar taste. It's amazing. We have just similar taste.

Unknown speaker 05:58 
And when we come back, I'm gonna ask you know, he's known he's such a formidable figure. If he's a controlling figure.

Unknown speaker 06:01 
We'll be right back with the Trumps on this edition of Larry King Live and don't forget the final of Apprentice three. That's right.

Unknown speaker 06:06 
Third year Apprentice is live Thursday night. We'll be right back.

Unknown speaker 06:14 
We're back with the Trumps, Donald, Melania, okay?

Unknown speaker 06:17 
Is he a control freak?

Unknown speaker 06:20 
I don't think he's control freak. He's perfectionist.

Unknown speaker 06:24 
Well, that's

Unknown speaker 06:25 
that's a slight difference.

Unknown speaker 06:26 
It is, but

Unknown speaker 06:27 
Does he make demands? I don't think so. Maybe he makes demands in his business because he needs to, you know, he's kind of a general. He needs to, you know, have people in line, but not at home. We are very equal in the relationship and that's very important. You know, to marry a man like Donald is uh, you

Unknown speaker 06:50 
you know, you need to know who you are and you need to be very strong and smart and you know, he needs to know that he could rely on me sometimes, you know, and we share a lot of stuff together. I don't think he's control freak at all.

Unknown speaker 07:05 
Does he bring work home?

Unknown speaker 07:07 
Yes, sometimes. But he's working all the time. You know, Saturdays, Sundays, he's playing golf, he's working all the time.

Unknown speaker 07:24 
Doesn't bother you?

Unknown speaker 07:25 
No. It's his passion. He loves it. It doesn't bother me. I don't wanna change him. I I don't want, you know, to say come home and you know, be with me. I don't wanna change him. I want to give him a space and I think that's very important in the relationship.

Unknown speaker 07:33 
Could you just tell me the one thing that troubled you about marriage was the feeling that you have to give up some of yourself that you can't be the workaholic you are because of the demands of the nature of a

Unknown speaker 07:42 
relationship. Yeah, I I don't consider myself a workaholic. I mean I work, but it's not work. It's like you. I mean, I love what I do, so it's no longer work. It's not like work. I mean work to me is going on a two week vacation. If somebody said you have to go away for two weeks, you're going to Africa on a safari. There's not gonna be any phones. You know what? You

Unknown speaker 08:02 
get me out of here, right?

Unknown speaker 08:04 
So that's to me like that would be work. But what Melania is so good at, we just have this natural relationship. It's like my mother and father were married sixty three years. I've always heard you have to work at a good relationship. My father didn't work at a good relationship. He went home, he had dinner, he went to bed, he took it easy, he watched television.

Unknown speaker 08:22 
My mother the same thing. She cooked them dinner and it was just one of those things. It wasn't work, but I always heard you have to work, work, work at a. You're not working at this.

Unknown speaker 08:30 
No, because look, I work very hard from early in the morning to late in the evening. I don't wanna go home and have to work at a relationship. I mean that's it. A relationship we have to work at it in my opinion doesn't work. So maybe I'm wrong.

Unknown speaker 08:41 
Do you cook?

Unknown speaker 08:42 
I cook sometimes. When we stay home and very something very fast and you know, but we are out most of the time, so I don't really have you know, time to cook.

Unknown speaker 08:52 
What is it like to have everything economically. But that I mean, you go down Fifth Avenue, you look in a window like something, you know, you can buy.

Unknown speaker 08:59 
What's it like?

Unknown speaker 09:01 
Well, it's you don't have any financial pressure.

Unknown speaker 09:04 
Yes, but you don't you know, um, I grew up you always you know, taking care of the money. You always you're not like a you know, big spender and you're saying like okay, I will buy it even if I don't like it for hundred percent. You know, you really need to love it that you buy it.

Unknown speaker 09:21 
So you're not just shop to shop.

Unknown speaker 09:23 
I'm not just shop to shop. He's just he has never taken advantage of that situation, okay? As many women would have frankly. I mean she's not one that sees a a beautiful something in a Fifth Avenue or Madison Avenue window and said I'm gonna get it or please get over.

Unknown speaker 09:39 
She it's not her thing.

Unknown speaker 09:40 
You know, I made a lot of money myself. So it's like I know how it's to work and what money means. So it's not that I will say okay, now I will have the latest bag. I I want that bag and then in a one month that bag will be in the closet inside that it's not even you know, it's kind of funny if you have that bag. It's like not in fashion. I'm not into that.

Unknown speaker 10:04 
There's a very nice side of you, generous nice side of you and I'd like to tell about it when we come back.

Unknown speaker 10:09 
The Apprentice Thursday night, don't go away.

Unknown speaker 10:13 
What don't we know about him?

Unknown speaker 10:14 
What do we know public not know about him?

Unknown speaker 10:17 
Not know. Um, amazing heart. He likes to help people. He has friends. He's loyal to it. He is um, great sense of humor. And I think you know, people know him more since the Apprentice, the way he is. He cares about people.

Unknown speaker 10:39 
I had a friend

Unknown speaker 10:40 
She's doing a very good job tonight. Thank you. I had a friend told me that if he had a problem

Unknown speaker 10:44 
he would call you. Why don't you let that happen more?

Unknown speaker 10:50 
Well, I think the press doesn't really like hearing that to be honest with you. I mean I do a lot of things and and I don't like to talk about them, but they'd much rather see me, you know, beating someone up then being nice to somebody. You know, it fits the image better for them. And and I think that's fine. It doesn't matter, but I love to help people. I do. I love helping people. There's nothing better. There's nothing that makes me feel

Unknown speaker 11:11 
good.

Unknown speaker 11:12 
Yes. But I I don't think that's the image that the press really wants for me. You know, they develop sort of an image for somebody and that's what they wanna go with and I think that's probably one of the reasons the Apprentice did so well and which is interesting about the Apprentice is that I fire people. That's what I do. I fire people.

Unknown speaker 11:45 
Do you mean thing?

Unknown speaker 11:46 
Do you have a favorite for Thursday night?

Unknown speaker 11:47 
No, I do a mean thing and everyone thinks I'm so much nicer than before. You know, they used to think that I was really this horrible flame throwing terrible tyrant, right? Now I go on a television show where basically what I do is I fire people and everyone thinks I'm such a nice guy, which tells you what a bad image I had

Unknown speaker 11:51 
Yes, I have.

Unknown speaker 11:52 
No, I know you. We're not gonna have any

Unknown speaker 11:53 
Yeah, I can't say anything.

Unknown speaker 11:54 
Do do you try to influence him?

Unknown speaker 11:55 
Uh, we talk about it.

Unknown speaker 11:57 
Does she have impact with you? Well, the fact is I have Georgia and Caroline, but I also have Georgia and Caroline and I have my little Melania.

Unknown speaker 12:03 
The truth is she does. She has a a person that she thinks is very good on the Apprentice, number three, the one doing on Thursday night and and she's told me that and I think that's totally fair.

Unknown speaker 12:13 
Of course, she's your wife.

Unknown speaker 12:14 
Yeah, I think that's

Unknown speaker 12:15 
And does it impact you? I mean it does and and Mark Burnett generally Mark wants me to do exactly what I wanna do and he's an incredible guy and a good guy, a really good guy. There's another guy that that is a wonderful guy.

Unknown speaker 12:28 
But everyone's in a while he'll say something that you know, I like to listen to people what they think, especially Mark or Melania or people that I respect.

Unknown speaker 12:37 
Where are you from?I'm from Slovenia. I'm from Slovenia and I grew up there um, as a teenager and I left at fifteen years ago.To come to went to Milan and then Paris and then I went to New York. I came to New York ten years ago.

Unknown speaker 12:54 
Did you wanna be a model?

Unknown speaker 12:55 
Yes, I was modeling. I was modeling in Milano, Paris and then came to New York and I had very successful career.

Unknown speaker 13:04 
You still want her to model?

Unknown speaker 13:06 
Well, she's doing an Aflac commercial and I was very I was very Dan Amos was the chairman of Aflac who's done an amazing job.

Unknown speaker 13:15 
He wanted to do where the duck turns into this beautiful swan or beautiful duck and they said okay, the concept is great. Now we're gonna supply you with like twenty five women and you can choose the one you want. He said no, I don't wanna look at anybody. I want Trump's wife. If you're hurt and can't work, Aflac can help pay your bills with cash.

Unknown speaker 13:39 
Genius!

Unknown speaker 13:41 
It's been a tremendous success, right?It was great success. Had a great time to shoot it.

Unknown speaker 13:45 
Would you then not mind if she did fashion modeling?

Unknown speaker 13:48 
Well, she can do it. She doesn't wanna do too much anymore. She was very successful. I don't think she wants to do a lot of modeling, but she's having fun and she's given a lot of offers and she turns many of them down, most of them down. She liked doing the Aflac one because it was so different and it's such a great commercial.

Unknown speaker 14:01 
It is funny. Very funny.

Unknown speaker 14:02 
We'll be back with some more moments with Donald and Melania Trump. Don't go away.

Unknown speaker 14:07 
ABC has a Trump bio picture coming called Trump Unauthorized, scheduled May twenty fourth. You said you'll sue if there are inaccuracies.

Unknown speaker 14:14 
Correct. Yeah, I'll sue. I mean

Unknown speaker 14:16 
if it's inaccurate. I'm not worried. Hey look, it's gonna go on, it's gonna go off, nobody's gonna remember, who cares. But I'm going to uh, you know, I let them know. I'm very honored that they're doing it. It's a great honor. You know, they're doing a two hour movie on me on national you know, network television and so I'm honored in one way. In another way I want to be accurate. So if it's not accurate, I will sue. You're not trying to stop it.

Unknown speaker 14:44 
It's pretty tough to stop. Yeah, it's hard to. You know who's playing you? An actor who is he's quite a bit shorter than me, but he's a handsome guy, so I'm I'm okay. I hope the women are also

Unknown speaker 14:51 
short.

Unknown speaker 14:52 
It's not nobody plays me. It's uh, his past life. Oh. Prior to. Yes, it's before me and it's like a stories. His life was you know, open books, so everybody sees.

Unknown speaker 15:03 
Do you know his exes?

Unknown speaker 15:04 
Yes. Get along with them? I don't see them much. I don't you know, we don't see them. We don't socialize.

Unknown speaker 15:10 
Uh, no.

Unknown speaker 15:11 
Well, that was a misconception. They weren't invited to the wedding and they're wonderful. You know, Ivana's wonderful. Marla's wonderful and actually uh, Melania doesn't know Ivana. Maybe I don't think I ever met her, but it doesn't know and does know Marla and she has a great relationship with Marla.

Unknown speaker 15:28 
But she doesn't know Ivana.

Unknown speaker 15:30 
Did you root for them to be happy?Absolutely. I want them to be happy. Absolutely. They're the mother of my children, the mothers of my children. So I want them to be happy and I have a good relationship with both of them.

Unknown speaker 15:39 
Do you worry about women and him being attracted to him?

Unknown speaker 15:41 
No. I don't worry about that at all. Worry about men? I know I know who I am and um, if a man doesn't wanna be with me or I don't wanna be with the man.

Unknown speaker 15:51 
Goodbye and good luck.

Unknown speaker 15:53 
That's right.

Unknown speaker 15:54 
I don't worry about her with men.

Unknown speaker 15:56 
No.

Unknown speaker 15:57 
I know her.

Unknown speaker 15:58 
That's the rock.

Unknown speaker 15:59 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
