```
Allocation = (Technical_Capability × 0.3) + (Market_Reach × 0.25) + 
             (Financial_Resources × 0.2) + (Strategic_Fit × 0.25)

Apple:     (0.85 × 0.3) + (0.75 × 0.25) + (0.95 × 0.2) + (0.80 × 0.25) = 0.835 → 24%
Google:    (0.95 × 0.3) + (0.95 × 0.25) + (0.90 × 0.2) + (0.85 × 0.25) = 0.915 → 30%
Anthropic: (0.90 × 0.3) + (0.60 × 0.25) + (0.70 × 0.2) + (0.95 × 0.25) = 0.808 → 23%
xAI:       (0.75 × 0.3) + (0.70 × 0.25) + (0.80 × 0.2) + (0.85 × 0.25) = 0.770 → 23%
```

### **MODEL B: RISK-ADJUSTED ALLOCATION**

```
Risk_Adjustment = Base_Allocation × (1 - Risk_Factor)

Google:    30% × (1 - 0.25) = 22.5% → 23%
Anthropic: 23% × (1 - 0.10) = 20.7% → 21%
xAI:       23% × (1 - 0.30) = 16.1% → 16%

Remaining 20% held in reserve/arbitration fund
